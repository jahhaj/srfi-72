This directory contains the implementation by André van Tonder that
was originally hosted at:

http://www.het.brown.edu/people/andre/macros/index.htm

That page no longer responds, so I've downloaded that page and the
most recent version (6.0.2) of the implementation from the Wayback
Machine here:

and stored them in this Github repo.

Thanks to Jeronimo Pellegrini for suggesting this and for finding this
copy on the Wayback Machine.
